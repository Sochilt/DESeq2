📊 DESeq2 Differential Expression Analysis
This repository contains scripts, example datasets, and output files used for conducting differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2, a widely-used Bioconductor package for analyzing count-based RNA-seq data.

🔍 What This Repository Does
*Normalizes raw RNA-seq count data
*Performs differential expression testing between sample groups (e.g., treatment vs control)
*Produces a list of significant genes that are differentially expressed
*Produces volcano plots (code for standard and enhanced volcano plot)
